# Splunk DNSGuard AI: Comprehensive DNS Anomaly Detection System

## What is DNSGuard AI?

Splunk DNSGuard AI is a sophisticated cybersecurity solution designed to detect and identify malicious DNS (Domain Name System) activity within enterprise networks. By leveraging Splunk's powerful search capabilities and advanced machine learning techniques, the application monitors DNS traffic patterns to identify anomalies that could indicate command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, reconnaissance, or other malicious activities.

The system offers a comprehensive defense mechanism that goes beyond traditional signature-based detection by analyzing behavior, timing patterns, and statistical anomalies in DNS queries across the organization.

### Key Benefits

- **Real-time Detection**: Continuous monitoring of DNS traffic for immediate threat identification
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multiple detection methods working in concert to identify various types of threats
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Scalable solution designed for large network environments
- **CIM Compliance**: Fully compatible with Splunk's Common Information Model

## Detection Methods Implemented

DNSGuard AI incorporates the following detection methods, each targeting a specific type of DNS-based attack vector:

1. **Beaconing Detection**: Detects regular, periodic DNS queries at consistent intervals—a hallmark of malware communicating with command and control servers. Analyzes consistency of time gaps between queries to the same domain.

2. **C2 Tunneling Detection**: Identifies hosts making an unusually high number of DNS queries, which could indicate command and control communication or data exfiltration through DNS tunneling. Uses density function to find hourly query count outliers by source.

3. **Query Length Anomalies**: Detects unusually long DNS queries that may represent data exfiltration channels where sensitive information is encoded in the query itself. Identifies outliers in query string length by host.

4. **Domain Shadowing**: Identifies patterns where many unique subdomains are requested for a legitimate domain, which may indicate an attacker using compromised DNS accounts to create malicious subdomains. Measures distinct subdomain count by parent domain and identifies outliers.

5. **TXT Record Anomalies**: Detects unusual use of TXT records, which are commonly abused for data exfiltration or command transmission due to their ability to carry arbitrary data. Identifies outliers in TXT record usage by host.

6. **ANY Record Anomalies**: Identifies reconnaissance activity using ANY queries, which attackers use to efficiently gather information about a domain's DNS configuration. Identifies outliers in ANY record usage by host.

7. **HINFO Record Anomalies**: Detects attempts to gather host information through specialized HINFO record queries, often used for reconnaissance. Identifies outliers in HINFO record usage by host.

8. **AXFR Record Anomalies**: Identifies zone transfer attempts that could indicate an attacker gathering comprehensive DNS infrastructure information. Identifies outliers in AXFR record usage by host.

9. **Behavioral Clustering**: Groups hosts with similar abnormal DNS behavior, which can reveal coordinated attacks or infected host groups across the enterprise. Uses KMeans clustering on multiple DNS behavior features.

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented as a Splunk application with the following components:

- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Uses density-based anomaly detection, K-means clustering, and statistical analysis to identify outliers in DNS traffic.
- **Splunk's Common Information Model (CIM) Integration**: Built on top of Splunk's Network Resolution datamodel for standardized data access.
- **Automated Analysis Pipeline**: Continuously monitors DNS traffic and applies appropriate detection algorithms based on traffic patterns.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle enterprise-level DNS traffic volumes without performance degradation.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard System**: Includes specialized dashboards for each detection method and an overview dashboard for high-level threat monitoring.
