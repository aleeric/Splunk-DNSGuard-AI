## Overview

DNS Guard AI is a Splunk App designed to detect various types of DNS anomalies that could indicate malicious activity such as command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or reconnaissance. The system uses Splunk's powerful search capabilities combined with machine learning techniques to identify patterns that deviate from normal DNS behavior.

   # Create a new directory for the project
   mkdir Splunk-DNSGuard-AI
   cd Splunk-DNSGuard-AI
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Splunk-DNSGuard-AI.git
   ```

3. **Install Splunk App**
   - Copy the `Splunk-DNSGuard-AI` directory to your Splunk apps directory:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: POC/TESTING ONLY**  
> The following steps (4-7) are **optional** and intended **only for testing and POC purposes**. These steps involve generating and importing synthetic data, which should **never** be performed in a production environment. Use these steps only in a dedicated test environment.

4. **Generate Test Data**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the POC directory
   cd poc
   
   # Generate synthetic DNS data
   python generate_dns_events.py
   ```

5. **Import Data into Splunk**

   **Option 1: Using Command Line**
   ```bash
   # Import the generated data
   splunk add oneshot -index poc -sourcetype _json -source dns_events.json
   ```

   **Option 2: Using Splunk Web Interface**
   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Add Data
   - Click "Upload" and select the `dns_events.json` file
   - In the "Select Source" step:
     - Set "Source type" to `_json`
     - Set "Index" to `poc`
   - Click "Next" and review the settings
   - Click "Submit" to start the import

6. **Map Data to Network_Resolution Data Model**
   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Data Models
   - Select "Network_Resolution" data model
   - Click "Edit" ‚Üí "Add Dataset"
   - Add the `poc` index to the list of indexes
   - Save the changes

7. **Verify Installation**
   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to the DNS Guard AI dashboard
   - Verify that data is being displayed
   - Check that all detection methods are working

### Synthetic Data Details

For testing and demonstration purposes, the application includes a custom Python script that generates synthetic DNS data specifically for the app‚Äôs proof of concept. The generated events adhere to the Common Information Model (CIM), particularly the Network Resolution data model, ensuring compatibility with Splunk‚Äôs detection and enrichment features. The synthetic dataset simulates a wide range of DNS anomalies

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMINDER**: This synthetic data is for testing purposes only and should never be used in a production environment.
