## Overview

DNS Guard AI is a Splunk App designed to detect various types of DNS anomalies that could indicate malicious activity such as command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or reconnaissance. The system uses Splunk's powerful search capabilities combined with machine learning techniques to identify patterns that deviate from normal DNS behavior.

   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to Settings → Add Data
   - Click "Upload" and select the `dns_events.json` file

   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to Settings → Data Models
   - Select "Network_Resolution" data model
   - Click "Edit" → "Add Dataset"
   - Add the `poc` index to the list of indexes
   - Save the changes

7. **Verify Installation**
   - Open Splunk Web
   - Navigate to the DNS Guard AI dashboard
   - Verify that data is being displayed
   - Check that all detection methods are working

### Synthetic Data Details

The synthetic data generated for testing purposes includes various types of DNS anomalies designed to demonstrate DNSGuard-AI's detection capabilities:

- **Optimized for Detection**: Each anomaly is specifically engineered to trigger the corresponding Splunk detection macro
- **C2 Tunneling**: High volume of DNS queries concentrated in hourly windows to trigger density-based outlier detection
- **Beaconing**: Precisely timed queries with minimal jitter to establish clear communication patterns
- **TXT Record Anomalies**: Suspicious encoded content in TXT records with command-like prefixes
- **ANY/HINFO/AXFR Records**: Targeted use of rare record types for reconnaissance
- **Query Length Anomalies**: Extremely long DNS queries exceeding threshold limits
- **Domain Shadowing**: Large number of unique subdomains for a single parent domain

> ⚠️ **REMINDER**: This synthetic data is for testing purposes only and should never be used in a production environment.
